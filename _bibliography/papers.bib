  abstract = "{The twisted string actuator (TSA), as a recently discovered artificial muscle, has attracted a lot of attention as a compliant and powerful actuation mechanism. A TSA consists of two strings attached to a motor on one end and a load on the other end. The motor’s rotation twists the strings and generates linear actuation. A common challenge is to obtain TSAs’ strains using compact approaches. Previous studies exclusively utilized external position sensors that not only increased system cost, size and complexity, but also lowered actuator compliance. In this paper, self-sensing strategies are presented to estimate TSAs’ strains without external sensors. By incorporating conductive and stretchable nylon strings, called super-coiled polymer (SCP) strings, into TSAs, their strains can be estimated from the resistance values of SCP strings. Two self-sensing configurations are realized: (1) TSA with one regular string and one SCP string, and (2) TSA with two SCP strings. Experiments are conducted to show the correlation between the length and resistance of TSA under different conditions. Polynomial and Preisach hysteresis models were successfully employed to capture the Length – Resistance correlation and to estimate TSA’s length using the resistance.}",

  abstract={Gripper hardware design often involves a tradeoff between distinct and sometimes opposing goals (e.g., high grasping force vs. gentleness). To address this trade-off within a single device, we present a multi-mode gripper with fingers that are scissor linkages, that can actively transform between three distinct modes by varying the number and locations of mechanical singularities. Each of these modes has properties that are suitable for specific needs. MODE 1 provides high grip strength, using a short lever arm and rigid structure. MODE 2 allows precise finger positioning and in-hand manipulation, using two independently controlled DOFs per finger. MODE 3 provides underactuated grasping that can passively adapt to delicate or irregularly shaped objects, with four DOFs per finger. The kinematic relationships, joint torques, and fingertip forces are derived analytically for each of the three modes. Gripper pe},
