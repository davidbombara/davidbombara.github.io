We may overlook how deeply our environment shapes us — our personalities, our careers, our values. As I navigate my time at Harvard, I’m realizing how inextricably my journey is linked to Boston.

Reflecting upon it, it’s not about settling for a life that could have been marginally improved somewhere else — say, in sunny California. Rather, it’s recognizing that Boston, with its distinct flair and vibrant academic culture, is central to my personal, educational, and career development. It’s about embracing the thought, “I am so glad I went to Harvard and not Stanford,” at my graduation.

Boston’s unique academic fabric has played a significant role in shaping my education. The opportunity to attend classes with pioneers like Rob Wood, Sangbae Kim, and Russ Tedrake is not something you find just anywhere. Their unique research philosophies have deeply impacted my understanding of my field, encouraging me to think beyond the conventional. The hands-on work in the state-of-the-art Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) at Harvard further enhances my learning.

Living in Boston is an adventure in itself. Its walkable neighborhoods, bustling with life and activities, are a constant source of inspiration. Cambridge, in particular, is an intellectual haven that encourages the pursuit of knowledge. Its cycling culture, safety, and the rediscovery of the importance of family make Boston an incredibly nurturing city.

However, all these benefits and unique experiences are meaningless without success — the success that I believe is only achievable because of Boston. And in this context, success isn’t just about career progression or academic accomplishments. It includes the relationships I’m building, the community I’m part of, and the personal growth I’m experiencing.

To sum it up, it’s about acknowledging that my journey in Boston is not about comparing or compromising — it’s about appreciating the uniquely Boston experiences that are shaping me into the individual I am becoming. And for that, I will always be grateful for this beautiful city and the institution I am privileged to learn from.
