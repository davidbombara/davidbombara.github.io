Hi there, I'm David Bombara, Ph.D. student at the [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/). I received a bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/).

I am proud to be supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Previously, I was supported by the [NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities Program](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/nstgro). As part of the fellowship, I was able to spend the summer of 2022 as a visiting researcher in the Dexterous Robotics Team of NASA Johnson Space Center.

To see my work, check out my [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) and [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/). Time permitting, I also write [blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/).
