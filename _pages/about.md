I am a Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/) in the [Computational Robotics Lab](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/group/) at the [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/). I am supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the Harvard Graduate Prize Fellowship.

Before coming to Harvard, I completed a master's degree advised by [Dr. Jun Zhang](https://packpages.unr.edu/jun) in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.unr.edu/me) at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/) (UNR). UNR is my alma mater, where I also received a bachelor's in mechanical engineering. 

During my master's degree, I was supported by the [Graduate Dean's Merit Scholarship](https://www.unr.edu/grad/admissions/funding/awards/graduate-dean-awards) and the [NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities (NSTGRO) Program](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/nstgro). As part of NSTGRO, I was fortunate to spend a summer as a visiting researcher at [Robotic Systems Technology Branch](https://www.nasa.gov/er/er4) of [NASA Johnson Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html).

During my master's degree, I also spent signficant time completing research (remotely) under the mentorship of [Dr. Hyun Jung Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=U8evG04AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in the [Advanced Measurements and Data Systems Branch](https://amdsb.larc.nasa.gov/) of [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley).
